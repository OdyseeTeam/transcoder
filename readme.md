![Test Status](https://github.com/OdyseeTeam/transcoder/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

## Development

Requires go 1.22.

## Building

To build the x86 Linux binary, which is used both for `conductor` (controller part) and `cworker` (transcoding worker part):

```
make transcoder
```

#### Docker images

```
make conductor_image cworker_image
```

This will build and tag images with a version tag, as well as the `latest`. To push latest images:

```

docker push odyseeteam/transcoder-cworker:latest
```

`cworker` image is using ffmpeg image as a base. To update or rebuild it, see [its dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile-ffmpeg) and run:

```
make ffmpeg_image
```
